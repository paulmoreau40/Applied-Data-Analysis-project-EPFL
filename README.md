### Abstract

At first glance, one might think that the pope does not have much impact on our everyday life and on our country’s politics, yet his opinion affects over 1.3 billion Catholics worldwide and he regularly meets with the most powerful political figures of the planet. Here, we want to investigate how one of the mightiest apolitical figures on Earth influences one sixth of the world population by using a novel quotations corpus : Quotebank. Our main approach consists in placing the pope on the American political spectrum, alongside to several emblematic Democrats and Republicans politicians, by extracting meaningful features from the quote corpus of each of our selected speakers. More precisely, we focused on analysing how important are key topics such as politics, economics, war and religion to our speakers by looking at the prominent lexical fields present in their statements.

### Research questions

* Can we place the Pope on a simple political spectrum (American Democrats vs Republicans) using solely the quotations ?
* What are the key features of the quotations we will need to do this ?
  * Is the use of lexical fields in an individual's citation corpus sufficient?

### Methods

The political spectrum we chose to place the Pope on is the American bipartite system with the Democratic and Republican Partys. We chose this system because Quotebank corpus is in English, their political spectrum is particularly simple due to its binarity and a lot of data (i.e. quotations) come from American politicians. Our general approach consists in :
1. Extracting meaningful features from the quotations corpus of the pope
2. Doing the same for a few emblematic American political figures 
3. Applying a principal component analysis (PCA) to visualize the primary results, one datapoint per speaker
4. Testing methods of feature selection to improve the accuracy and interpretability of the results
5. Appreciating the relative position of the politicians with regards to the pope in a final 2D PCA with the selected features

We chose six Democrates and six Republicans with a substantial number of quotes and with varied predicted position on the political spectrum (either central or on the edge of the spectrum) [2,3,4].

| Political figure | Party      | Predicted position   | Number of quotations |
|------------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Elizabeth Warren | Democratic | Edge     | 48'397               |
| Bernie Sanders   | Democratic | Edge     | 84'018               |
| Hillary Clinton  | Democratic | Central   | 95'458               |
| Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes | Democratic | Edge | 18'653 |
| Pete Buttigieg | Democratic | Central | 24'523|
| Kamala Harris | Democratic | Central | 19'091|
|------------------|------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Ben Carson | Republican | Central | 22'448 |
| Marco Rubio| Republican | Edge | 41'650 |
| Nikki Haley| Republican | Central | 24'533 |
| Ted Cruz         | Republican| Edge    | 46'301               |
| Mike Pence       | Republican| Edge     | 46'893               |
| Mitt Romney      | Republican| Central| 10'651               |

#### Pre-Processing
First, we transform the speakers' probability from object type into float numbers to simplify future analysis. We eliminate from the data the quotes that have too low a first speaker probability. Then, we perform simple pre-processing steps on the quotes such as removing the digits, punctuation, spaces at the beginning and ending of quotes, capitalization from words (case folding) and removing rows with empty quotes. We also tokenize the quotes (break the strings into tokens) to remove the stop words and lemmatize the quotes to focus on meaning. Finally, after performing these steps, we delete quotes that are not in English with a pre-trained model from fastText.

#### Feature extraction
Then, we extract interesting features in the quotes that could ideally be used to cluster the different speakers into political groups and enable to find the Pope's position on this political spectrum. The first features that we extract for each speaker are:
* The median of the number of words in the quotes
* The median of the number of characters in the quotes
* The median of the number of occurences of the quotes
* The richness of the vocabulary, that we compute by counting the number of unique different words in the pre-processed quotes and by dividing it by the total number of quotes of the speaker.
* The scores returned by the Empath library's parsing function for all available lexical categories.
* Pronouns perspective: the way a speaker talks based on frequency of the pronoun used (I, you, we).

#### Features selection for the final 2D PCA 

This task was performed on three parts:

* Features with low variance were removed at a threshold based on their distribution 
* When two features were too highly correlated (|r| >= 0.95) one was removed
* A random forest of 10’000 trees was trained to find the optimal combination of features.

This selection led us to the the 29 following features:
cold, occupation, nervousness, royalty, wealthy, blue collar job, college, optimism, real estate, home, divine, reading, leader, celebration, violence, military, air travel, meeting, urban, appearance, warmth, youth, politics, breaking, power, terrorism, negative emotion, children, I
